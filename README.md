# NCET Buddy — Exam Infrastructure for Educators

**NCET Buddy** is a specialized brand under **Exam Buddy**, an Ed-Tech infrastructure provider that connects expert content creators (YouTubers, independent educators, and coaching institutes) with enterprise-grade examination technology. We enable educators to monetize their expertise by delivering NTA-like proctored mock tests to their students—without any technical overhead or upfront costs.

---

## 1. Platform Overview

### What is NCET Buddy

NCET Buddy is a plug-and-play examination platform designed for competitive exam preparation. It provides a high-security, proctored testing environment that mimics the National Testing Agency (NTA) interface, reducing student exam anxiety and ensuring test integrity.

The platform serves as technological infrastructure for educators who have built audiences on YouTube, Telegram, or other channels, but lack the resources to develop custom apps or manage high-traffic testing environments.

### Why It Exists

Most online educators face three critical challenges:

1. **High Infrastructure Costs**: Building custom mobile apps or websites for mock tests requires significant capital investment.
2. **Technical Scalability**: Server crashes during peak traffic (live mock tests) lead to poor student experience and brand damage.
3. **Test Integrity**: Preventing question leaks, cheating, and maintaining exam-like conditions is complex and resource-intensive.

NCET Buddy solves these problems by providing ready-to-use infrastructure, allowing educators to focus on content creation and audience engagement.

### Current Focus: NCET (Testing Phase Strategy)

We are currently focused exclusively on the **National Common Entrance Test (NCET)** as our testing phase. This strategic focus allows us to:

- Validate the revenue-sharing model with a specific educator segment
- Refine the proctoring and anti-cheating mechanisms
- Gather feedback from students and educators in a controlled environment
- Perfect the operational workflow before scaling

### Vision: Multi-Exam Expansion

Once the NCET model is proven and operationally stable, Exam Buddy will expand to other competitive examinations, including:

- **JEE (Joint Entrance Examination)** — Engineering aspirants
- **NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test)** — Medical aspirants
- **CUET (Common University Entrance Test)** — Undergraduate admissions
- Other state and national-level entrance exams

The parent entity registration as **Exam Buddy** enables rapid expansion across exam categories without requiring new legal or operational setups.

---

## 3. Core Business Model

NCET Buddy operates on a **YouTube-like revenue-sharing model**, ensuring alignment of incentives between the platform and educators.

### The Revenue-Sharing Framework

#### No Upfront Fees for Educators

- Educators pay **zero setup fees** to join the platform
- No subscription charges or software licensing costs
- Free access to the mock test creation tools and infrastructure

This removes financial barriers to entry and allows educators to start monetizing immediately.

---

#### Free Mock Test Creation

Educators can create unlimited mock tests on the platform at no cost. The Exam Buddy expert team provides:

- Assistance with question digitization (converting PDFs, images, or handwritten content into structured digital format)
- LaTeX support for mathematical equations and scientific notation
- Quality assurance to ensure questions meet exam standards

---

#### Paid Educator Mock Tests for Students

- **Free Tests:** Students can access PYQ (Previous Year Question) mock tests for free, funded by the platform as a public good.
- **Paid Tests:** Students pay for educator-branded mock tests, which are promoted by the educators to their own audiences (YouTube, Telegram, Instagram, etc.).

The educator drives student demand through their existing channels, and the platform handles all technical execution.

---

#### Platform Commission Structure

Revenue from each paid test attempt is distributed as follows:

**Step 1: Management Cost Deduction**
First, operational costs are deducted:
- Payment gateway fees (e.g., PhonePe, Razorpay transaction charges)
- Server and infrastructure costs for delivering the test

**Step 2: Revenue Split**
After management costs, the remaining revenue is shared:
- **Educator Share:** The majority portion, rewarding content creation and audience promotion
- **Platform Share:** Retained by Exam Buddy for technology maintenance, expert support, and operations

This structure ensures:
- Educators are incentivized to create high-quality tests and promote actively
- The platform remains financially sustainable and can invest in infrastructure improvements
- No hidden fees or surprise deductions—complete transparency

---

### Ranking & Percentile Calculation

**Ranking Algorithm:**
1. Retrieve all results for the specific test
2. Sort by score (highest to lowest)
3. Assign rank based on sorted order
4. Handle ties: Students with the same score receive the same rank

**Percentile Calculation:**
1. Count total students who attempted the test
2. Count students who scored less than the current student
3. Percentile = (students below / total students) × 100

**Example:**
- If 1000 students attempted a test
- If 600 students scored less than you
- Your percentile = (600 / 1000) × 100 = 60th percentile (you performed better than 60% of students)

---

## 6. Payment & Monetization Flow

### Why Paid Tests Exist

**Value Exchange:**
